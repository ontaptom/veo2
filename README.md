# Imagen 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Veo2 Example

This repository contains the `imagen_and_veo2.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

This notebook provides an example workflow demonstrating how to:

*   Generate an initial character using **Imagen 3**.
*   Adapt the generated character into different scenes using the native image generation capabilities of **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.
*   Generate short video clips based on those scenes using **Veo 2**.
*   (Bonus: Merge the generated clips into a single video using `moviepy`.)

## Disclaimer

Please note that this notebook serves as a **basic example** and starting point to showcase the integration of these models. It is **not intended as a complete or production-ready solution**. You will need to adapt and expand upon it for specific use cases.

## Usage

Open and run the `imagen_and_veo2.ipynb` notebook in an environment like Google Colab, ensuring you have the necessary permissions and have configured your Google Cloud project and billing as required by the underlying APIs (be mindful of potential costs).
